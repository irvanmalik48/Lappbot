## What is it?

Lappbot is a modular Telegram userbot running on Python 3.8+ with an SQLAlchemy database.

Based on [KensurBot](https://github.com/KenHV/KensurBot), which is based on [Paperplane](https://github.com/RaphielGang/Telegram-UserBot) and [ProjectBish](https://github.com/adekmaulana/ProjectBish) userbot.
I made this fork to pick everything I need that is not available in original KensurBot.
